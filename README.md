# Top-App

    Picture Perfect
  - Description: Allows users to take a photo of a location then provides them with directions to the location as well as 
  allowing them to check in and the more the location gets visited it would be pinned as popular - possible follower/point 
  system for people who upload the most popular spots
  Category: Photography/Social
  
  - Mobile: Mobile first experience, this will be a purely mobile design because it uses GPS to help you find cool photo           locations 
  
  - Story: You always see people taking instagram/snapchat/facebook photos at cool locations, but rarely do people tag where       exactly they were, this allows everyone to find the spot and take their own cool pictures! 
  
  - Market: Any person who wants to discover new places. Good for all ages. 
  
  - Habit: People already try to go find new places on a weekly basis or check their socials to see who went where, so this
  is a good way to do both at the same time
  
  - Scope: The app should allow people to communicate with one another if they have question regarding the location or need 
  clarification on how to get there from people that checked in the location.
